# small-python-programs-with-gui

### In this repository I'm going to upload my **Python** programs with graphical user interface. At this point I'm using the tkinter library.  


> ## 01 calculator  
>
> This is my attempt at bulding a calculator. The code is not very Zen, but there you have it.  
  
> ## 02 photo_resize
>
> This program takes photos in 3:4 ratio, 72 dpi, named a certain way, resizes them automaticaly to either 240 by 320, or 300 by 400, and renames them. It's a very specific task I need for my work.

> ## 03_currency_calculator
>
> Gives estimate on currency convertion. It takes information from free API, so it's decently accurate, but shouldn't be relied to for large sums of money.

> ## 04_encoder_decoder
>
> Encodes messages and decodes them.
