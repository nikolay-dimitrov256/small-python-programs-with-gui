# small-python-programs-with-gui

### In this repository I'm going to upload my **Python** programs with graphical user interface. At this point I'm using the tkinter library.  


> ## 01 calculator  
>
> This is my attempt at bulding a calculator. The code is not very Zen, but there you have it.

> ## 02 photo_resize
>
> This program takes files in 1200 by 1600 pixels, 72 dpi, named a certain way, resizes them automaticaly to either 240 by 320, or 300 by 400, and renames them. It's a very specific task I need for my work.
